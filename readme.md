CovCoagCharacter
========================================================

This package creates a covariate summary of the target population, which can then be used as baseline characteristics.

Suggested Requirements
===================
- R studio (https://rstudio.com)
- Java runtime environment
- Python

IMPORTANT
===================
Note, in the output folder a PLP data object is created, which holds (aggreated) patient data. The PLP data object is saved locally to speed up the analysis, since data tables only need to be accessed once. Before compressing and submitting the results, please ensure that this PLP data object has been removed from the results folder.
